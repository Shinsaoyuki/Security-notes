# Security-notes

This repository contains technical notes created while studying
hands-on penetration testing (OSCP-oriented).

## Audience
- Security engineers
- Technical reviewers
- Interviewers

## Focus
- Enumeration and decision making
- Why certain attack paths were chosen or abandoned
- Reproducible and review-friendly documentation style

## Learning Goal
To build practical decision-making skills for penetration testing,
beyond tool usage and exploit execution.

## Structure (Planned)

### enumeration/
Decision making during initial reconnaissance.

- `nmap-decision-making.md`  
  How to decide next actions based on nmap results
- `service-priority.md`  
  Prioritization of exposed services
- `when-to-abandon-host.md`  
  Criteria for abandoning a target host

### web-attacks/
Web attack viability and abandonment criteria.

### privesc/
Privilege escalation assessment notes.

### documentation/
Reproducible note and report templates.


## Policy
- No real targets, IP addresses, flags, or full exploits
- Notes are abstracted for learning and explanation purposes only
